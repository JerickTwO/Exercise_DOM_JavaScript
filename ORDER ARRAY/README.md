# Number Sorter

This project is a simple tool that utilizes JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and sort numbers entered into an input field. The numbers should be separated by commas and will be sorted and displayed within a card.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Enter the numbers you want to sort into the input field, separated by commas.
4. Press enter or click the "Sort" button to see the sorted numbers displayed within the card.

## Example

If you input: `5, 2, 8, 1`

The result will be: `1, 2, 5, 8`
